            <h2>Advice / FAQs</h2>
            <h3>How do I get better at programming?</h3>
            <p>Just write more code lol, all you can do is practice. I'm slightly above mid, but I get better by writing more code.</p>
            <h3>How do I come up with side project ideas?</h3>
            <p>Do you have inconveniences in your life? If so, try to solve them with software. Alternatively, go through this <a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x">github repository</a></p>
            <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
            <p>Just learn a programming language, any language, with the intention of building a specific project or idea no matter how simple you think it seems.</p>
